# LeagueChampionRecommender

All information regarding the project can be found in notebook located at LeagueChampionRecommender/Jupyter Notebooks/Oracle Lens Neural Network.ipynb. This contains a report and the code used for the project.

This project uses a neural network to determine if we are able to accurately predict the outcome of a League of Legends game by only using pregame character selection data. 

We interacted with the Riot Games API to access this data.


The Tut file contains a python script that pulls data from the Riot Games API to get the information we need for the project. The basis for the script was introduced by Farzain M., but we modified it to get the data that we need.
